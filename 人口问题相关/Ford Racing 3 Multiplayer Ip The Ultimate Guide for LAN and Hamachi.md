However, playing Ford Racing 3 online can be tricky, especially if you want to play with your friends who are not on the same local network as you. The game does not have a built-in online matchmaking system, so you need to manually enter the IP address of the host player. You also need to configure your router settings to allow incoming and outgoing connections on a specific port.
 
In this article, we will show you how to play Ford Racing 3 online with your friends using a free software called Hamachi. Hamachi is a virtual private network (VPN) service that creates a secure connection between multiple computers over the internet. It simulates a local area network (LAN) environment, so you can play LAN games online without any hassle.
 
## Step 1: Download and Install Hamachi
 
The first step is to download and install Hamachi on your PC and your friends' PCs. You can get it from [https://www.vpn.net/](https://www.vpn.net/). Hamachi is free for up to five computers per network.
 
After installing Hamachi, launch it and create an account. Then, create a new network by clicking on the "Create a new network" button. Give your network a name and a password, and share them with your friends. Your friends can join your network by clicking on the "Join an existing network" button and entering the name and password of your network.
 
## Step 2: Configure Your Router Settings
 
The next step is to configure your router settings to allow incoming and outgoing connections on port 2300. This is the port that Ford Racing 3 uses for multiplayer communication. You need to do this only for the host player, who will create the game session and invite other players.
 
To configure your router settings, you need to know the name and model of your router and visit this site: [https://portforward.com/](https://portforward.com/). It explains how to access your router's web interface and set up port forwarding for different routers and games.
