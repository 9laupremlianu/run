If you are looking for a USB to parallel FIFO interface device, you might be interested in the FT245R chip from FTDI. The FT245R is a USB to parallel FIFO interface, with the new FTDIChip-IDâ¢ security dongle feature. In addition, asynchronous and synchronous bit bang interface modes are available. USB to parallel designs using the FT245R have been further simplified by fully integrating the external EEPROM, clock circuit and USB resistors onto the device[^1^] [^2^].

In this article, we will show you how to download and install the FT245R USB driver for Windows, which is necessary for using the FT245R chip or any device that incorporates it. The FT245R USB driver is compatible with Windows 10, 8.1, 8, 7, Vista and XP.
 
## Step 1: Download the FT245R USB Driver
 
The first step is to download the FT245R USB driver from the FTDI website. You can choose between two types of drivers: VCP (Virtual COM Port) or D2XX (Direct). The VCP driver emulates a standard serial port and allows you to use your FT245R device as a COM port in any application that supports serial communication. The D2XX driver allows you to access the FT245R device directly through a DLL interface[^1^].
 
To download the VCP driver, go to [https://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm](https://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm) and select the appropriate version for your operating system. To download the D2XX driver, go to [https://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm](https://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm) and select the appropriate version for your operating system.

## Step 2: Install the FT245R USB Driver
 
The second step is to install the FT245R USB driver on your computer. The installation process may vary depending on the type of driver and your operating system, but generally it involves running an executable file or extracting a zip file and following the instructions on the screen.
 
For example, if you downloaded the VCP driver for Windows 10 64-bit, you would run the file CDM21228\_Setup.exe and follow the steps below:
 
1. Click Next to start the installation.
2. Accept the license agreement and click Next.
3. Select a destination folder and click Next.
4. Click Install to begin copying files.
5. Click Finish to complete the installation.

If you downloaded the D2XX driver for Windows 10 64-bit, you would extract the file CDM21228.zip and follow the steps below:

1. Open Device Manager and locate your FT245R device under Other Devices or Universal Serial Bus Controllers.
2. Right-click on your FT245R device and select Update Driver Software.
3. Select Browse my computer for driver software.
4. Select Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer.
5. Select Universal Serial Bus devices and click Next.
6. Click Have Disk and browse to the folder where you extracted the D2XX driver files.
7. Select FTDIBUS.INF and click Open.
8. Select FTDI USB FIFO Device and click Next.
9. Click Install to confirm the installation.
10. Click Close to finish the installation.

## Step 3: Test the FT245R USB Driver
 
The third step is to test the FT245R USB driver and make sure it works properly with your device. You can use any application that supports serial communication or direct access to test your FT245R device. For example, you can use FTDI's own utilities such as FT\_PROG or MProg to program or configure your FT245R device[^1^]. You can also use FTDI's examples or tutorials to learn how to use your FT245R device in various scenarios
