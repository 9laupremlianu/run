## Step 2: Extract the Game Files
 
The next step is to extract the game files from the compressed archive. You will need a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip to do this. Right-click on the archive file and select "Extract Here" or "Extract to" and choose a destination folder.
 
If you are asked for a password during the extraction process, you can use one of these passwords:

These passwords are also mentioned in the NFO file or the README file that comes with the archive.
 
## Step 3: Mount or Burn the ISO File
 
After extracting the game files, you will find an ISO file in the destination folder. This is a disc image file that contains all the data of the game disc. You will need to mount this file on a virtual drive or burn it on a physical disc to install the game.
 
To mount the ISO file, you can use a program like Daemon Tools or PowerISO. Right-click on the ISO file and select "Mount Image" or "Open With" and choose your virtual drive program. This will create a virtual drive on your PC that will act as if you inserted the game disc.
 
To burn the ISO file, you will need a blank DVD and a DVD burner. You can use a program like Nero or ImgBurn to burn the ISO file on the disc. Insert the blank DVD into your DVD burner and launch your burning program. Select "Burn Image" or "Write Image" and choose the ISO file and your DVD burner as the source and destination respectively. Start the burning process and wait until it finishes.
 
## Step 4: Install the Game
 
The final step is to install the game on your PC. To do this, open your virtual drive or insert your physical disc into your DVD drive and run the setup.exe file. Follow the instructions on the screen and choose your preferred language and installation directory.
 
If you are asked for a CD key during the installation process, you can use one of these keys:

- BZ7A9-X488N-725MY-E9FND-TLPDZ (for Skidrow & Reloaded version)
