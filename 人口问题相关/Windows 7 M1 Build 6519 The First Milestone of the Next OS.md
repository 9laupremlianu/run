The HomeGroup feature was accessible from the installation process, where users could create or join a HomeGroup with a password.
 
The HomeGroup feature was designed to simplify the network sharing experience for home users, and it was also present in later versions of Windows 7.

The Backup and Recovery Center allowed users to create backups of their files and folders, restore previous versions of files, create system images, and create recovery discs.
