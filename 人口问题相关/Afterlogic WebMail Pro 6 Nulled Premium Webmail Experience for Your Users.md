OpenPGP is a standard for encrypting, signing, decrypting, and verifying emails right in the browser. All the crypto takes place directly in the browser, neither PGP keys nor decrypted data are sent to the server[^1^]. Paranoid Encryption is a strong AES-256 browser-based encryption in Files module. When enabled, encryption process occurs right in the browser, the server never has access to unencrypted data or encryption keys[^1^]. You can also create shareable links for your encrypted files with others using their public keys.
