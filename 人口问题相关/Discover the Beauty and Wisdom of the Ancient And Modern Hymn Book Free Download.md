But where did the Ancient and Modern hymn books come from? And what makes them so special? The Ancient and Modern hymn books are the result of a collaborative effort by a group of Anglican clergymen and musicians who wanted to provide a more comprehensive and updated hymnal for the Church of England. They collected hymns from various sources, such as the Book of Common Prayer, the Psalms, the ancient Latin and Greek hymns, the German chorales, the Wesleyan hymns, and the contemporary hymns of their time. They also revised some of the hymns to make them more suitable for modern worship, and composed new tunes and harmonies for them.
 
The Ancient and Modern hymn books were first published in 1861, and became an instant success. They were widely adopted by many churches in England and abroad, and influenced other hymnals that followed. They were also revised several times to keep up with the changing needs and tastes of the church. The latest edition, Ancient and Modern: Hymns and Songs for Refreshing Worship, was published in 2013, and contains over 800 hymns and songs that reflect the diversity and richness of the Christian tradition.
