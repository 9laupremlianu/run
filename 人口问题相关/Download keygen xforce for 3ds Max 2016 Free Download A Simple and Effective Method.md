- **Retopology tools**: You can automatically optimize the geometry of high-resolution models to create a clean, quad-based mesh topology with high accuracy. This can help you reduce complex and high-resolution assets and enhance generative designs and traditional modeling work inside of 3ds Max. [^2^]
- **Smart Extrude**: You can interactively extrude faces on 3D objects using flexible Smart Extrude operations like cut-through and overlap. You can also rebuild and stitch adjacent faces automatically without needing to manually repair hidden faces or geometric data. [^2^]
- **Open Shading Language (OSL) support**: You can create or use pre-existing procedural OSL maps with any supported renderer. OSL is a shading language that allows you to write your own shaders and share them with others. [^2^]
- **Baking to texture**: You can experience streamlined, intuitive, and fully scriptable texture baking. Texture baking is a process of transferring details from one model to another using textures. This can help you optimize your models for rendering or game engines. [^2^]
- **Integrated Arnold renderer**: You can use Arnold for 3ds Max (MAXtoA) to render your scenes directly from the interface. Arnold is a high-quality renderer that supports interactive rendering, global illumination, ray tracing, and physically based materials. [^2^]
- **Interactive viewports**: You can reduce design iteration with render-quality viewport previews, displaying PBR (physically based rendering) materials and camera effects directly. This can help you visualize your scenes more realistically and efficiently. [^2^]
- **Software security**: You can use Safe Scene Loading to protect your work from potentially malicious scripts that could be part of scene files. This can help you avoid unwanted changes or damage to your files. [^2^]

These are some of the features of 3ds Max 2016 that can help you create professional-quality 3D scenes and design visualizations. You can also use other features such as mesh and surface modeling, modifier stack workflow, spline workflows, texturing and shading, 3D rendering, animation and effects, workflow and pipeline, and more.
