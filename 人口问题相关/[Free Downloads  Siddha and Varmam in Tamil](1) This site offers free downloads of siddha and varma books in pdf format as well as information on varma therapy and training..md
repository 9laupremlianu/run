Varma kalai is an ancient martial art and healing system that originated in Tamil Nadu, India. It is based on the knowledge of vital points (varmam) in the human body, which can be manipulated to cause or cure various diseases and injuries. Varma kalai practitioners use their fingers, palms, elbows, knees, or weapons to strike or massage the varmam points.

Varma kalai is not only a form of self-defense, but also a holistic science that covers anatomy, physiology, psychology, spirituality, astrology, and medicine. It is said that varma kalai was taught by Lord Shiva to his consort Parvati, who then passed it on to their son Murugan. Murugan taught it to his disciple Agastya, who then spread it to the Siddhars (saints) and other disciples.
