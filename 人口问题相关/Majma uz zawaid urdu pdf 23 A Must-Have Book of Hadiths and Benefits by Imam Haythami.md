Majma Uz Zawaid Wa Manba Ul Fawaid (ÙØ¬ÙØ¹ Ø§ÙØ²ÙØ§Ø¦Ø¯ Ù ÙÙØ¨Ø¹ Ø§ÙÙÙØ§Ø¦Ø¯) is a famous collection of hadiths compiled by Imam Nur al-Din al-Haythami al-Shafi'i (d. 807 AH). It contains hadiths from various sources that are not found in the six canonical books of hadith, such as Musnad Ahmad, Musnad Abi Ya'la al-Hanafi, Mu'jam al-Tabarani al-Kabir, al-Awsat and al-Saghir. Imam Haythami graded the hadiths according to his own criteria and omitted the chains of narrators as they are available in the original books. He was known for his fairness and moderation in judging the hadiths. This book is a valuable resource for scholars and students of hadith.
 
The book consists of 10 volumes in Arabic and has been translated into Urdu by Abu al-Ala Muhayy al-Din Jahangir. The Urdu translation is published by Darul Ishaat Karachi and is available online for free download. The first volume covers topics such as faith, purification, prayer, zakat, fasting, pilgrimage, jihad, marriage, divorce, inheritance, etc. The 23rd chapter of the first volume deals with the virtues of reciting the Quran and its different surahs.
