Oedipa decides to investigate the play The Courier's Tragedy, which she suspects might be related to Pierce's stamp collection. She goes to a library and learns that the play was written by Richard Wharfinger, a mysterious and obscure playwright who belonged to a secret society called the Tristero. She also finds out that the play was heavily edited by its publisher, Thurn and Taxis, a historical postal service that competed with Tristero. Oedipa calls Driblette again, but he hangs up on her.
 
Oedipa visits Nefastis, who shows her his machine and tells her that only a sensitive person can make it work. Oedipa tries to operate the machine, but fails. Nefastis accuses her of being unsensitive and tells her to leave. Oedipa feels frustrated and paranoid. She wonders if Pierce is playing a prank on her or if she is losing her mind.
 
Oedipa meets up with Metzger and they go to an auction of Inverarity's stamp collection. There, she meets Genghis Cohen, a philatelist who has been appraising Pierce's stamps. Cohen shows her some rare stamps that have variations of the muted post horn symbol on them. He also tells her about an upcoming auction of a valuable stamp collection called Lot 49, which might contain some clues about Tristero.
